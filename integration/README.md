## 1. Overview
The Integration module ensures end-to-end coherence across the subsystems:
- End-to-end data pipeline assembly (Vision → Engineering → Knowledge → Backend → Frontend).
- Golden sample input/output fixtures for regression testing.
- Contract conformance validation verifying that all subsystem payloads satisfy schemas in `/contracts`.
- Mock harness and integration test runners.
